# **SSH Client Manager**

## **Project Description**

SSH Client Manager is a **secure and efficient** tool designed to **manage, store, and retrieve SSH credentials** with strong encryption. It enables users to securely store SSH connection details locally or in cloud storage services like **Google Drive** and **Dropbox**, ensuring accessibility across multiple devices while maintaining high-security standards.

## **Key Features**

### ðŸ”¹ **Secure SSH Credential Management**

- Store SSH login details **locally** or upload them securely to **Google Drive** or **Dropbox**.
- Access saved credentials from encrypted files, ensuring data integrity.

### ðŸ”¹ **Advanced Encryption & Security**

- **AES-256-GCM Encryption** â€“ Provides both encryption and authentication, preventing tampering.
- **Uses a 12-byte IV**, which is recommended for AES-GCM to ensure security and prevent nonce reuse attacks.
- **Argon2id Key Derivation** â€“ Protects against brute-force attacks by securely deriving encryption keys from user-provided passwords.
- **Salt Protection** â€“ Each encryption operation is hardened with a **32-byte salt**, stored securely in `Salt.bin`.

### ðŸ”¹ **Multiple Storage & Import Options**

- **Local Storage** â€“ Save credentials in an encrypted JSON file (`enc_ssh_config.json`).
- **Google Drive Integration** â€“ Seamlessly upload and retrieve encrypted SSH credentials via the **Google Drive API**.
- **Dropbox Integration** â€“ Securely store and retrieve credentials using the **Dropbox API**.

### ðŸ”¹ **Flexible SSH Connection Management**

- **Use Credentials Without Saving** â€“ Directly input SSH details for temporary use.
- **Securely Save New Credentials** â€“ Store encrypted SSH configurations locally or in the cloud.
- **Import Existing Encrypted Credentials** â€“ Retrieve and decrypt stored credentials from **local, Google Drive, or Dropbox storage**.

## **Why Use SSH Client Manager?**

âœ… **Secure** â€“ Uses modern encryption techniques to safeguard SSH credentials.  
âœ… **Convenient** â€“ Store SSH configurations locally or access them from the cloud.  
âœ… **Reliable** â€“ Prevents unauthorized access with built-in authentication and integrity verification.  
âœ… **Easy to Use** â€“ Simple command-line interface for seamless SSH credential management.

This project is ideal for **developers, system administrators, and cybersecurity professionals** who need a **secure and centralized** solution to manage multiple SSH connections efficiently.

## **What Motivated This Project?**

As a **cybersecurity professional**, I frequently manage multiple SSH connections across different environments, often requiring secure storage and easy retrieval of credentials. Traditional methods of storing SSH credentialsâ€”such as plaintext files, password managers, or environment variablesâ€”posed significant security risks, which became a growing concern.

During my search for a **free SSH client manager**, I quickly realized that most solutions failed to meet my needs. Many lacked **import functionality**, forcing me to manually re-enter credentials, while others didn't offer **cloud integration**, making remote access difficult. Additionally, several tools either stored credentials in **plaintext or used weak encryption**, leaving sensitive data vulnerable. Even more frustrating, many options were locked behind **paywalls**, limiting access to essential features unless I paid for a premium version.

This gap motivated me to **create my own solution**â€”an **SSH Client Manager** that addresses these issues and provides:  
âœ… **Secure storage** by encrypting SSH credentials with **AES-256-GCM**, ensuring data confidentiality.  
âœ… **Cloud accessibility** via **Google Drive** and **Dropbox**, while maintaining **end-to-end encryption**.  
âœ… **Import functionality** for encrypted SSH credentials, eliminating the need for manual entry.  
âœ… **Protection against brute-force attacks** using **Argon2id key derivation** with a **32-byte salt**.  
âœ… **An open-source, completely free solution**, offering reliable and secure management for developers, system administrators, and security professionals.

By creating this tool, I sought to bridge the gap between **security** and **convenience**, ensuring that SSH credential management is **safe**, **efficient**, and **flexible**â€”without the limitations of paid alternatives.
